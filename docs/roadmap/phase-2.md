Phase 2 theme: Durable Household Core.

## Completed Slice 2.1 — Durable Lists Foundation
Durable Lists Foundation combines the persistence foundation, generic Lists domain, deterministic development seed data, generated NSwag client workflow, and Shopping List widget conversion from in-memory state to API-backed persisted list data.

## Completed Slice 2.2 — Widget/Layout Persistence
Widget/Layout Persistence adds household-owned workspace layout storage, seeded default layouts that match the validated dashboard, minimal get/save layout APIs, generated NSwag client support, and frontend layout loading with default fallback. The widget catalog remains application-owned; persisted layout records only choose catalog widgets and their placement metadata.

## Completed Slice 2.3 — Manual Events Source
Manual Events Source originally added the first writable HomeOps-owned event source with household-owned event persistence, deterministic seed data, minimal event source and event CRUD APIs, normalization into the existing Agenda event model, generated NSwag client support, and embedded Agenda validation UI for retrieval, create, update, and delete.

## Completed Slice 2.4 — Backend-Backed Agenda Layer Settings
Backend-Backed Agenda Layer Settings adds device-scoped persistence for Agenda source visibility, a generated local device key sent through API headers, independent Week and Months settings, minimal get/save APIs, generated NSwag client support, and frontend replacement of browser-only layer settings storage.

## Completed Slice 2.5 — Event Editing UX Hardening
Event Editing UX Hardening improves the embedded Agenda event form with create/edit/delete usability, all-day and timed input handling, frontend validation, backend validation problem responses, loading/error states, and regression coverage while preserving existing Agenda views and sources.

## Completed Slice 2.6 — EventSeries Contract + Migration
EventSeries Contract + Migration replaces occurrence-shaped local calendar persistence with non-recurring EventSeries as the primary HomeOps calendar entity, adds dynamic EventOccurrence projection for Agenda rendering, preserves existing event CRUD behavior and source filtering, and keeps recurrence, EventException, Google Calendar, import/export, ICS, reminders, notifications, authentication, and timezone UI out of scope.

## Completed Slice 2.7 — Calendar Terminology, Projection, and Timezone Foundation
Calendar Terminology, Projection, and Timezone Foundation aligns API contracts and UI wording around EventSeries/HomeOps Calendar terminology, hardens EventOccurrence as projection-only output, persists household timezone on Household with initial `Europe/Amsterdam` fallback behavior, and realigns roadmap documentation around HomeOps Calendar as source of truth, Google Calendar as optional integration, and JSON export as the future canonical portability format.

## Completed Slice 2.8 — Calendar JSON Export and Full Restore Foundation
Calendar JSON Export and Full Restore Foundation adds a versioned canonical `homeops.calendar.export` JSON backend contract, exports household timezone metadata, event source metadata, and EventSeries source-of-truth records, keeps EventOccurrence out of canonical export data, and adds full restore-only backend behavior that validates before replacing calendar sources and EventSeries. Google Drive remains a future export destination only. ICS, recurrence runtime behavior, EventException runtime behavior, selective import, merge import, and conflict resolution remain out of scope.

## Completed Slice 2.9 — Calendar Portability Hardening, Restore Safety, and JSON Contract Freeze
Calendar Portability Hardening freezes the V1 canonical JSON contract, reserves recurrence, exception, and future metadata sections, strengthens schema/version/identifier/ownership/timezone/timing validation, and keeps restore local-only and full-restore-only. Restore validation occurs before destructive actions, rejected exports leave calendar data unchanged, and automatic pre-restore export is documented as a future safety requirement rather than implemented automation.

## Recommended Next Slice
Proceed with Real Google Calendar Read-Only Integration or automatic pre-restore export only after preserving HomeOps Calendar as source of truth. Keep any Google Calendar work optional and integration-scoped; do not add two-way sync, authentication beyond an explicitly scoped integration requirement, sensors, media, notifications, recurring event editing, or offline-first synchronization.
